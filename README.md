1. I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:
title
url link
description
rating (1-5)
--I can add, and cancel aa bookmark when creating it with the criteria.

2. I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app
--Bookmarks are visible with a button to see description and a delete button.

3. All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view
--All bookmarks are condensed unless you click on the "more info" button.

4. Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link
I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list
--You can go to website and see the description when expanded.

5. I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark
--error alerts are working properly

6. Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)
I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
-- Rating work properly

7. (Extension feature - optional) I can edit the rating and description of a bookmark in my list
-- I was unable to get this one done.
